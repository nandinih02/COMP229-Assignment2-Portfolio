  <p>This is my first group project in Game Programming! This is a game called Phantom Breakout, it was made by myself and three other memebers.
  The game is about a young boy who has lost his way in a dark maze, his goal is to find the Orb of Light and bring it back to it's rightful place
  other wise he will be stuck in that maze for all eternity with ghouls and ghosts of all kinds. While making this game, I was the assets developer
  as well as general programmer. I also created the cover image (as you see next to this text).

  <p>This is a project I am currently working on called Lil Oli's Lil Journey. It is being made by myself and four other members. The game is about

  I am a general programmer and technical artist. The image next to this text is our team logo.
